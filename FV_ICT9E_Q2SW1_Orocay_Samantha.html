        <td><font size= 3>Pomeranians are distinguished by their luxurious double coat and foxy face with alert, prick ears. The body is fairly square, with a fluffy tail that curls up and over the back. A thick ruff around the neck completes the picture of a dog who can handle the northern German snows. The muzzle is distinct and the head is somewhat rounded.</td>
        <td><font size= 4>This elegant, very clever dog has a natural drive to work and is a fantastic student, which makes them popular as mountain rescue or sniffing dogs. Border Collies make devoted pets who enjoy company and stimulation.</td>
        <td><font size= 3>Poodles are one of the most easily recognized dog breeds. The agile, enthusiastic, and intelligent Poodle is capable of far more than just being attractive. Despite being primarily known for their elegant appearance. Learn more about this well-known Non-Sporting Group breed.</td>
